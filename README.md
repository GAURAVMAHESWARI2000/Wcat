# Wcat
JAVASCRIPT code to make clone of cat command in linux and some additional features


The cat (short for “concatenate“) command is one of the most frequently used commands in Linux/Unix-like operating systems. cat command allows us to 
create single or multiple files, view content of a file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files.
In this program, i have made a clone tool similar to cat which i have named "wcat" and will develop few handy wcat commands.

In order to give this custom Tool a feel of an original one, i've created a custom script that enabled us to use wcat in place of npm run wcat while 
doing/performing something with my Tool.

Before Proceeding, install the node before trying to run it if you haven't already.
